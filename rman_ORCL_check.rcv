  # This script will be used to crosscheck and validate backup.
  # Since we may accept this operation to run slower than ordinary backup, I will
  # make an explic allocation of a single channel in order not to use the
  # same degree of parallelism that we configured in the default rman environment.
  # Please remember that parallelism will not work with Standard Edition:
  # if you allocate more sbt_tape channels while using SE, only one channel will be used;
  # moreover you will get RMAN warnings which might be interpreted as failures
  #

  # - restore validate will not write anything: it will only READ the backup
  # - restore database validate will use the latest full or level 0 backup,
  #   regardless of its retention policy (long-term or stadard retention)
  # - restore archivelog all would try to restore all archivelog hence it
  #   would raise errors for any deleted archivelog. Validating archivelog
  #   in the last 36 hours ( from time ' sysdate - 36 / 24 ' ) seems to be 
  #   reasonable
